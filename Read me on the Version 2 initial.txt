This folder contaimns all the files needed for checking the signal status onlime.
If you are concernbed about the status of the signal you only need the "calculate baseline code", nothing else. 
You can remove the audio files and the specific lines which are calling that files and reading, for your convenience.

Things to remember for running the code successfully:

Update on 11/8/2016

(1) Currently the GUI takes the scalpmap from the current folder(pwd). So you can change that to plot your own specific
channel location file.

(2) You might have to change the ip (host) address in the code dependeimng upomn the system you are working on. This address
you can find in windows machine running the command prompt using "ipconfig/all" command. Check specifically for the IPv4 address and 
update that on the code in creating the cfg structure

cfg.host='your ip address';
cfg.port=(51244); (for the 32 bit data)

(3) Currently for successfully running the code you need to add to "common programs" and "tcp_udp_1p_(64/32)" dependeing upon your machine.
